                          The website operator takes your privacy very seriously and will treat your personal information confidentially and in accordance with the law. As changes to this privacy policy may be made as a result of new technologies and the continued development of this website, we encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly.<br>

                          Definitions of the terms used (e.g. "personal data" or "processing") can be found in Art. 4 of the GDPR.

                            We, the website operator, collect data regarding website access on the basis of our legitimate interest (see Art. 6 (1) lit. DSGVO) and save these as "server log files" on the server of the website. The following data is logged:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Website visited</li>

                            The server log files are stored for a maximum of 14 days before they are deleted. Data is stored for security reasons, for example to clarify cases of abuse. If data must be retained for reasons of proof it is excluded from the deletion until the incident has been finally clarified. These server log files are stored at netcup GmbH (Wilhelm-Kolb-Straße 1a, 76817 Karlsruhe). The cooperation with netcup GmbH takes place within the framework of a DGSVO compliant contract for the processing of data on our behalf. We are authorised to give instructions to the provider with regard to your data and can request the disclosure, amendment, correction or deletion of your data at any time.

                            The website operator will only collect, use and transfer your personal data if this is permitted by law or if you have given your express consent.
                            The term personal information refers to all information that is used to identify your person and which can be traced back to you - for example your name, email address and telephone number.<br>
                            You can also visit this website without giving any personal information. To improve our online offer, however, we (without personal reference) store your access data on this website. This access data includes, for example, the files you have requested or the name of your internet service provider. Due to the anonymisation of this data it is not possible to trace it back to your person.

                            We use Google Analytics, a web analysis service from Google Inc. (‘Google’) as part of our legitimate interest for the optimisation and analysis of our online service in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f. GDPR.<br>
                            Google uses cookies. Information produced by the cookie about how the online service is being used by the user is generally transferred to a Google server in the USA and saved there. Google uses this information on our behalf to assess how users make use of our online service, to produce reports about activities within this online service, and to generate further services connected with the use of this online service and internet usage. From the processed data we are able to create pseudonymous user profiles of users.<br>
                            We only use Google Analytics with active IP anonymisation. This means that the IP addresses of users are shortened by Google within EU member states and in other states that have signed the European economic zone treaty. Only in exceptional situations is the full IP address transferred to Google’s server in the USA and shortened there. The IP address received from the user’s browser is not combined with any other data from Google. The user can prevent cookies from being saved with the corresponding browser software settings. The user can also prevent the data produced by cookies during their use of the online service from being transferred to or processed by Google, by simply downloading and installing the browser plugin available <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl">here</a>.<br>

Data stored by us, if no longer necessary for it’s original purpose and not within a legal retention period, will be deleted. If deletion cannot be carried out because the data is required for legitimate legal purposes, data processing will be restricted.
